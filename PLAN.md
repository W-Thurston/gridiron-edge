# Gridiron Edge — Development Plan

> **Purpose:** the active implementation plan for the currently selected
> program and bounded unit. Completed program details belong in `CHANGELOG.md`,
> durable architecture in `DECISIONS.md`, current operations in `HANDOFF.md`,
> and future priorities in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Where to find other information

| Document | Role |
|----------|------|
| **PLAN.md** (this file) | The active program and its one bounded implementation unit |
| **ROADMAP.md** | Strategic priorities, genuine future capabilities, and known limitations |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | What was built and when |
| **HANDOFF.md** | How the system works today: architecture, workflows, operations, and recovery |
| **DECISIONS.md** | Append-only architectural decisions and supersession history |

## Ways of Working

These practices apply to every program and implementation unit. A new thread
should read this section before planning or modifying the repository.

1. **Confirm before building.**
   Never assume code, schemas, artifacts, commands, tests, or documentation
   exist or have a particular shape. Inspect the current repository state
   before proposing a change. Prefer a small read-only audit over implementation
   based on stale context.

2. **Locate first, then read the owning boundary.**
   Use targeted searches to identify the relevant files, functions, tests,
   commands, artifacts, and generated contracts. Read the exact owning
   boundaries before designing or editing them.

3. **Design at two levels before implementation.**
   - **Program level:** lock the capability, motivation, boundaries, sequence,
     dependencies, and success criteria in `ROADMAP.md`.
   - **Unit level:** add one bounded implementation unit to `PLAN.md` with its
     goal, design decisions, tests, and acceptance criteria before changing
     code.

4. **Keep one active bounded unit.**
   `PLAN.md` may retain a concise summary of completed programs, but detailed
    completed-unit records are removed during major program closeout. Only one
    implementation unit should be active at a time. New work starts only
    after it is selected from `ROADMAP.md` and scoped for execution.

5. **Use descriptive implementation language.**
   Program and unit identifiers belong in planning documents only. Source
   names, comments, docstrings, tests, artifacts, commands, and commit subjects
   should describe lasting domain behavior rather than when the behavior was
   added.

6. **Commit small coherent units.**
   Each completed unit should produce one focused commit with a Conventional
   Commit subject and a detailed bullet-list body covering implementation,
   tests, and documentation. The corresponding `PLAN.md` update belongs in the
   same commit as the unit's implementation.

7. **Run focused gates during implementation.**
   Run linting, type checking, and focused tests after each meaningful change.

   At a Python contract boundary, run:

   ```bash
   uv run ruff check . --fix && \
   uvx pyrefly check && \
   uv run pytest -m "unit and not slow"
   ```

   At a frontend contract boundary, run:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm lint
   pnpm build
   pnpm test:run
   cd ..
   ```

   Run integration, end-to-end, external-source, network, or slow gates when
   the affected boundary requires them.

8. **Verify against real artifacts and responses.**
   After backend, data, model, API, or frontend integration changes, inspect
   the generated artifact or live response directly. Validate the relevant row
   counts, identities, uniqueness, coverage, provenance, representative
   values, timestamps, joins, and blocker states. Green tests do not replace
   real-data verification.

9. **Preserve generated-file ownership.**
   Regenerate checked-in schemas, clients, and derived contracts through their
   owning commands. Do not hand-edit generated artifacts.

10. **Close each unit completely.**
    After implementation and validation:
    - remove temporary migration and diagnostic scripts;
    - update affected operational and architectural documentation;
    - condense the completed `PLAN.md` unit to exactly these headings:
      `Completed`, `Goal`, `Files Added/Removed/Changed`, `Tests`, and
      `Acceptance`;
    - list every committed file added, removed, or changed, grouped by category
      with a concise description of its lasting responsibility or modification;
    - explicitly state `None` when an Added, Removed, or Changed category has no
      entries;
    - include the completed `PLAN.md` update in the same commit as the unit's
      implementation;
    - record durable architectural choices in `DECISIONS.md`;
    - record shipped behavior in `CHANGELOG.md`;
    - update `HANDOFF.md` only when the current operational contract changes;
    - update `ROADMAP.md` when future scope, sequencing, or priority changes;
    - verify that the staged file list agrees with the
      `Files Added/Removed/Changed` section;
    - inspect the staged diff before committing.

    Use this completed-unit structure:

    ```markdown
    #### Completed

    Concise description of the implemented behavior and resulting contract.

    #### Goal

    The lasting purpose of the unit.

    #### Files Added/Removed/Changed

    Added:
    - `path/to/new_file.py` - Lasting responsibility of the new file.
    - None.

    Changed:
    - `path/to/existing_file.py` - Behavioral or contract change.
    - `tests/path/test_file.py` - Regression or acceptance coverage.
    - None.

    Removed:
    - `path/to/retired_file.py` - Superseded responsibility that was removed.
    - None.

    #### Tests

    Focused tests, quality gates, integration checks, and real-data validation
    performed for the unit.

    #### Acceptance

    Concise statement proving the unit's intended contract is implemented,
    validated, documented, and ready for downstream use.
    ```

    Include only categories and files that reflect the committed unit scope.
    Do not list files that were merely inspected. Temporary scripts removed
    before the commit are not committed files and should not appear in the
    file-change inventory.

    Before committing, run:

    ```bash
    git diff --cached --name-status
    git diff --cached --stat
    git diff --cached --check
    ```

11. **Do not preserve development-era compatibility without a current need.**
    Gridiron Edge has never been live in production. Existing development
    schemas, artifacts, commands, tests, generated contracts, and historical
    behavior may be replaced when the active design requires it, unless a
    current contract explicitly requires compatibility.

12. **Use explicit dates and repository history.**
    Trust explicit user-provided dates, commit timestamps, and repository
    history. When dates conflict or are ambiguous, state the exact date being
    used rather than relying on relative wording.

## Planned Implementation Status

### Active Program: Weekly Prediction Input Integrity and Reproducibility

Units 1 through 5 completed history-preserving weekly refresh, deterministic complete-history Elo reconstruction, exact persisted Elo-lineage enforcement, external disposition of the affected immutable 2026 Week 2 forecast evidence, and immutable prediction-input evidence for newly generated live weekly forecasts.

Corrected operational forecast generation and evaluation, model-quality assessment, and explanation evidence remain inactive future units.

Market Unit 26 remains active but calendar-gated in:

- `docs/programs/market-unit-26/PLAN.md`
- `docs/programs/market-unit-26/ROADMAP.md`

### Statistical Availability Metadata Preflight Alignment [Completed September 22, 2026]

#### Completed

Aligned weekly statistical-model availability with the persisted metadata
contract already enforced by live prediction execution.

Availability now requires the exact registered feature-set identity, current
integer modeling schema version, and exact ordered feature columns before
declaring a statistical family available.

Stale but well-formed metadata makes only the affected family unavailable.
Malformed model identity, artifact kind, and task remain explicit errors.

#### Goal

Reject stale statistical artifacts during read-only availability inspection
before policy selection and model execution.

Preserve execution as an independent fail-closed validation boundary while
preventing availability from selecting an artifact that execution would reject.

#### Files Added/Removed/Changed

Changed:

- `PLAN.md`
  - Closed the statistical availability metadata preflight alignment unit.
- `src/gridiron_edge/models/game_prediction/availability.py`
  - Added exact feature-set identity and modeling schema version checks to the
    existing ordered feature-column availability contract.
- `tests/unit/models/game_prediction/test_availability.py`
  - Updated valid metadata fixtures and added missing, malformed, stale, and
    family-isolation coverage.

Removed:

- None.

#### Tests

Validation passed:

- focused Ruff checks;
- repository-wide Ruff checks;
- Pyrefly;
- Python compilation;
- 84 focused availability, policy, weekly-execution, and weekly-CLI tests;
- the full non-slow unit suite;
- `git diff --check`.

Focused coverage proves:

- valid current metadata remains available;
- missing or incorrect feature-set identity is unavailable;
- missing, null, Boolean, string, and stale modeling schema versions are
  unavailable;
- exact ordered feature columns remain required;
- stale metadata affects only the exact family;
- malformed identity, kind, and task remain explicit errors;
- availability does not deserialize estimators or scalers;
- execution remains an independent unchanged fail-closed boundary.

Protected real-artifact validation inspected the current 2026 Week 2 schedule
through the public availability boundary. Elo and all five statistical families
were available:

- `win_prob / logistic`;
- `win_prob / random_forest`;
- `win_prob / xgboost`;
- `total / random_forest`;
- `total / xgboost`.

A before-and-after SHA-256 comparison of every model, metadata, and scaler
artifact under `data/models/` produced no differences.

Independent read-only review confirmed all requested correctness, ordering,
scope, and non-mutation requirements and approved the unit for documentation
closure.

#### Acceptance

Availability requires exact persisted feature-set identity, current integer
modeling schema version, and exact ordered feature columns before declaring a
statistical family available.

Missing, malformed, or stale model-contract metadata makes only the affected
family unavailable before policy execution.

Malformed artifact identity, kind, and task remain explicit errors.

Availability rejects stale metadata before runtime feature construction and
does not deserialize estimators or scalers.

Live prediction execution retains its independent strict metadata validation
and remains fail-closed.

Current real statistical artifacts pass the tightened preflight without
regeneration or modification.

No model artifact, forecast, prediction-input evidence, weekly product, API,
frontend, or persisted schema contract changed.


### Development Forecast Role Foundation [Completed September 22, 2026]

#### Completed

Added an explicit development forecast role for retrospectively generated
canonical weekly fixtures without representing those fixtures as pre-kickoff
live issuance.

Development events can carry exact immutable prediction-input evidence,
participate in one role-coherent selected weekly product, and undergo exact
selected-event postgame closeout.

Live-only recommendation qualification and production-chain proof remain
isolated from development evidence. Spread production provenance now explicitly
inherits the live-role requirement from its source Win forecast.

#### Goal

Add a truthful forecast role for retrospective canonical development fixtures
while preserving the existing meanings and safety boundaries of live and
backfilled forecasts.

Keep the normal weekly prediction command live-only, provide a dedicated
development execution boundary, preserve existing persisted schemas and
evidence, and modify no operational artifacts.

#### Files Added/Removed/Changed

Changed:

- `PLAN.md`
  - Closed the development forecast role foundation after independent review.
- `src/gridiron_edge/evaluation/forecast_contracts.py`
  - Added `ForecastRole.DEVELOPMENT` and bounded selected-weekly role policies.
- `src/gridiron_edge/evaluation/forecast_events.py`
  - Updated role documentation for all supported forecast roles.
- `src/gridiron_edge/evaluation/prediction_input_evidence.py`
  - Authenticated exact live or development families while rejecting
    backfilled and mixed-role evidence.
- `src/gridiron_edge/evaluation/prediction_input_evidence_store.py`
  - Updated selected-weekly evidence documentation without changing storage.
- `src/gridiron_edge/evaluation/live_forecast_closeout.py`
  - Matched events against exact persisted product roles and exposed selected
    Win and Total roles in closeout results.
- `src/gridiron_edge/models/game_prediction/product_validation.py`
  - Allowed live or development products while enforcing one role across every
    available selected component.
- `src/gridiron_edge/models/game_prediction/weekly_execution.py`
  - Added distinct live and development wrappers over one role-aware execution
    boundary.
- `src/gridiron_edge/market/production_chain_preflight.py`
  - Required derived Spread production provenance to inherit the source Win
    live role.
- focused unit and integration tests
  - Added role, evidence, product, closeout, execution, qualification,
    production-proof, and disposition-preservation coverage.

Removed:

- None.

Operational artifacts changed:

- None.

#### Tests

Validation passed:

- repository-wide Ruff checks;
- Pyrefly;
- the full non-slow unit suite;
- focused selected-event closeout integration tests;
- focused production-chain repository integration tests;
- `git diff --check`.

Focused tests prove:

- development is distinct from live and backfilled;
- live and development events authenticate exact prediction-input evidence;
- backfilled and mixed-role evidence are rejected;
- weekly products enforce one role across all available games and families;
- development events close against completed outcomes using exact persisted
  product roles;
- live and development execution wrappers produce one coherent role across Win
  and Total;
- the weekly CLI continues to invoke only the live wrapper;
- development provenance fails recommendation qualification;
- Moneyline, Spread, and Total production proof remain live-only;
- development events cannot authenticate the original live Week 2 defect scope.

Protected read-only validation proved:

- 2026 Week 3 Logistic Win and Random Forest Total schema-1 evidence each
  authenticated against 16 live events;
- the existing Week 2 disposition authenticated successfully;
- the disposition applies to the selected affected Week 2 product and does not
  apply to the selected Week 3 product;
- before-and-after SHA-256 inventories of predictions, weekly products, and
  prediction-input evidence were byte-identical.

Independent read-only review found no blocking defects and approved closure
after reverting three unrelated type-coercion changes from the production-chain
file.

#### Acceptance

`ForecastRole.DEVELOPMENT` has a durable meaning distinct from live and
backfilled.

Live and development events can carry exact immutable prediction-input
evidence. Backfilled and mixed-role evidence cannot authenticate selected-weekly
claims.

Weekly products may use live or development events but require one coherent
role across every available selected component and game.

Selected-event closeout matches the exact role persisted by the weekly product
and reports Win and Total roles explicitly.

The existing weekly command remains live-only. Retrospective fixture generation
has a dedicated development execution boundary with no current production
caller.

Qualification, candidate, recommendation, and production-proof boundaries
remain live-only. Spread inherits that eligibility from its exact source Win
forecast.

The original Week 2 defect disposition and existing Week 3 schema-1 evidence
remain valid.

No persisted schema or operational artifact changed.
